# ApartmentBot
Python script that checks a website for a certain floor plan that I am interested in and emails me whether or not the floor plan is available.  Using BeautifulSoup and SMTP, the script pulls the HTML from the apartment website, checks if "Floor Plan: A3" is in the HTML, and emails me that is either available or not available.
